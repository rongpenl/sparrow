# Sparrow

> This is not a repo that you *simply* star and leave it along.

Sparrows are small but they hvae all the vital organs. [麻雀虽小,五脏俱全](https://bit.ly/2FMQH54).

This repository organizes data science projects which are 
1. small such that its organization/architecture is factored to small parts to digest.
2. complete such that it goes beyond notebook and script and may use certain software/tools (deliberately).
3. reproducible that a learning guide is provided.

Check out other projects of the **S (parrow) H (ummingbird) O (wl) W (oodpecker)** family.
